/* The GLSL 4.20 spec, v11, says:
 *
 *     "A link error will result if two compilation units in a program
 *      specify different integer-constant bindings for the same
 *      opaque-uniform name. However, it is not an error to specify a
 *      binding on some but not all declarations for the same name, as
 *      shown in the examples below."
 *
 * Although this restriction is not included in the
 * ARB_shading_language_420pack spec, it is reasonable to believe that
 * it applies to it too.
 *
 * Different bindings for an opaque type (sampler2D) with the same name
 * in different compilation units are ignored if they are unused.
